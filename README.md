# Inofficial Clockify OpenAPI spec

This is a inofficial Clockify OpenAPI spec based on the
[official docs](https://docs.clockify.me).

Sadly Clockify does not publishes a OpenAPI spec and the API docs seem to be incomplete.
Therefore, this OpenAPI spec should help you to e.g. generate SDKs in the language you need.

See
[Swagger UI](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aeimer/clockify-openapi-spec/refs/heads/main/clockify-openapi-spec.yaml).

DISCLAIMER:
This is 100% best effort and not related in any kind to Clockify!
